# Typescript Jest Conversion Tool

This CLI tool will convert a normal node/js project to a structure to work with Typescript and run the tests with Jest. This will *NOT* convert any javascript files to typescript files.

It does depend for 2 features on you, you have to move the files to the proper folders. I advice you to use vscode while doing this, since it will ask if it should update the paths throughout the files. So it will find the moved files.

## Usage:

```shell
npm install -g typescript-jest-conversion-tool
```

The go to the repository you want to convert (same folder as your package.json)

Then run:

```shell
tjc
```

This will come will all kinds of promts to ask what you would like.
